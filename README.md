# TriviaGame
As part of this project, I was tasked with writing a trivia game. We were given two options: all of the questions on one page with a single timer, or individual questions with their own timers. I chose the latter. 

 I used the following technologies for this: 
 - HTML/CSS 
 - Javascript/JQuery 
 - Bootstrap 

Some functionality highlights: 
- Timers on each question, counting down the time to answer 
- Counting wins, losses, timeouts
- Shows an image and plays a sound based on win, lose, or timeout 
- Uses basic Bootstrap components
